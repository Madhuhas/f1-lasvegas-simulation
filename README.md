# 🏁 Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix Simulation

This project combines racing passion with data analytics. Using **EA Sports F1 23**, I simulated the Las Vegas Grand Prix as Carlos Sainz, captured race telemetry, and explored key performance metrics via data visualization.

## 🎮 Simulation Setup

- Game: EA Sports F1 23
- Driver: Carlos Sainz
- Track: Las Vegas Grand Prix (night race, 50% race length)
- Data collected: Lap times, tire compound usage, fuel consumption, sector timings, final positions

## 📊 Visualizations

- **Starting Grid vs Final Race Positions**  
  Highlights overtakes, pit strategy, and how qualifying affected final outcome.

- **Lap Time Consistency**  
  Tracks improvement and degradation lap-by-lap.

- **Tire Compounds Used**  
  Visualizes stint strategy: softs, mediums, tire wear impacts.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Sainz gained +3 positions through early pit strategy on mediums
- Lap 12 showed fastest sector time—great tire performance window
- Consistent lap times despite high tire wear in final stint

## 📂 Project Structure

├── data/ # Cleaned telemetry data ├── notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks for visualization ├── PDF/ # Images of plots and charts


## 🧠 Conclusion

Formula 1 teams process 20–40TB of data per race weekend. Visualizing that data — even in a simulation — helps uncover hidden performance insights and race strategy.
